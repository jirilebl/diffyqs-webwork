# Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}.
It is decreasing as time goes on.
$PAR
Since concave down means \(u_{xx} < 0\), that means \(u_t < 0\) meaning \(u\)
is decreasing at this point.
$PAR
The physical intuition is that the heat equation is trying to evenly distribute
the heat within the rod, so a concave down graph means there is too much heat
at this point and so it must be flowing away from this point.
