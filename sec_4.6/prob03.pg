# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The following scenario describes the temperature \(u\) of a rod at position \(x\) and time \(t\).
$PAR
Consider the equation \( u_t = u_{xx} \), \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( t > 0 \),
with boundary conditions \( u(0,t) = 0 , u(1,t) = 0 \).
$PAR
Suppose the initial condition is
\( u(x,0) =
\sin(n \pi x) \) .
$PAR
That is, the initial condition is a sine wave of frequency \(n\).  Suppose \(V(t)\) denotes the maximum
variation of temperature on the rod at time \(t\), that is, the maximum temperature
minus the lowest temperature.  We are interested as to what happens as \(n\)
grows.

# Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}
$PAR
The solution will be \( e^{-n^2\pi^2 t} \sin(n\pi x) \).
The min and max of \( \sin \) is \(\pm 1\), so 
\( V(t) = 2 e^{-n^2\pi^2 t} \).  \(V(t)\) goes to zero, and
as \(n\) grows \(V(t)\) goes to zero faster.
