BEGIN_PGML
A cannonball is shot straight up from the ground at speed [$a] meters per second.
Let [:h:] be the height in meters and let [:t:] be time in seconds.

What is the differential equation that must be solved
assuming the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared downwards?

[` h'' = `] [_________]{"-9.8"}{30}
[@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

Assume the cannonball is shot up at time [:t=0:] seconds.
(Remember the initial speed is [$a] meters per second upwards.)

What is the formula for the neight of the ball at any time [:t:]?

[` h = `] [_________]{"-4.9*t^2 + $a*t"}{30}
[@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

At what time will the cannonball return to earth?  That is, when will
the height be 0 again?

[_________]{"$a/4.9"}{30} seconds

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The acceleration is -9.8 (it is negative as it is downwards) so the equation is

>>[`` h'' = -9.8 . ``]<<

Integrating once gets us [`h' = -9.8 t + C_1.`]
As the initial velocity is [`h'(0) = [$a]`], then clearly, [`C_1=[$a]`], and so
[`h' = -9.8 t + [$a].`]
Integrating again,
[`h = -4.9 t^2 + [$a] t + C_2.`]  The initial position is ground level, that is
[`h(0)=0`], so [`C_2 = 0.`]  So

>>[`` h = -4.9 t^2 + [$a] t . ``]<<

The ball is at ground level when [`h=0`], that is when
[` -4.9 t^2 + [$a] t = 0 `] or in other words
[` (-4.9 t + [$a] ) t = 0 .`]  So the two times that the ball is
at ground level is when [`t=0`] (when it is fired) and at

>>[`t=\frac{[$a]}{4.9} = [$ans] `]<<

seconds when it lands.
