The radioactive isotope carbon-14 is present in small
quantities in all life forms, and it is constantly replenished until
the organism dies, after which it decays to stable carbon-12 at a rate
proportional to the amount of carbon-14 present, with a half-life of
$h years (half-life is how long it takes for half of the carbon-14 to decay).  Suppose \( C(t) \) is the amount of carbon-14 present at time
\( t .\)

Find the value of the constant \( k \) in the differential 
equation \( C'=-kC .\)

In 1988 three teams of scientists found that the Shroud of Turin, which
was reputed to be the burial cloth of Jesus, contained about
$p percent of the amount of carbon-14 contained in freshly made cloth
of the same material[1].  How old was the Shroud of Turin in 1988, according
to these data?

BEGIN_SOLUTION

If \(C\) is the amount of carbon-14 in the shroud, we know that
\(C'=-kC,\) and so that \(C=C_0e^{-kt}.\)
$PAR
Since the half-life is $h years, \(\frac{1}{2} C_0=C_0 e^{-$h k}.\)
Solving for \(k\), we have \(-$h k=\ln (1/2)\) so
\(k=\frac{-\ln(1/2)}{$h} \approx $kval .\)

$PAR
From the given information, we have \(0.91=e^{-kt} ,\) where \(t\)
is the age of the shroud.  Solving for \(t,\) we have
\(t=\frac{-\ln 0.91}{k} \approx $tint\) years.

$PAR
As an aside, the half-life of carbon-14 is internationally accepted
to be \(5568\pm30\) years.  The value used in this problem is chosen
to be in that range.
